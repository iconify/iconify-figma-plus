## Figma Plus

Figma currently does not support plug-ins.

To install this plug-in you need [https://figmaplus.com](Figma Plus). Figma Plus adds plug-in system to Figma, making it possible to add new functionality to Figma!

## What is Iconify?

Iconify is new unified SVG framework. It is designed to replace outdated glyph fonts with modern JavaScript SVG framework
and offer massive choice of icons. Unlike fonts, Iconify only loads icons used on pages, so you can use icons from FontAwesome,
Material Design Icons, Firefox Emoji and more on web page without loading many fonts. It is fast and very easy to use.

See [https://iconify.design/](https://iconify.design/) for details.

In addition to SVG framework, Iconify is available as React component (components for other frameworks will be available later). See [https://github.com/iconify/iconify-react](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-react)
